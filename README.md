## Project Structure

Signature Generator and Verifier code is located in the src directory.
The documentation is in the same directory, in a Jupyter Notebook named signature_generator_verifier.ipynb. (Only Available in Portuguese)

You can run the Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

    jupyter notebook

Or by using the VSCode extension or the plugins available in your current IDE.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies in an isolated manner.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

If you don't already have virtualenv installed, you can install it with the following command:

    pip install virtualenv

Now, create the virtual environment by running the following command:

    virtualenv .venv

After that, activate the environment with:

    source .venv/bin/activate

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies using the requirements.txt file.

For that, run the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After installation, all the necessary dependencies will be available to run the project.
